# Note Taker

## Description

This application is a note taking app that saves notes taken and deletes notes when the user clicks the delete icon.  This project was made using starter code and individual contributions from me using express, uniqid, and heroku for deployment.

## Installation

Use "npm install" in your terminal to update to the latest modules used. After that is completed, run "npm start" to start hosting.  Navigate to your local host in a browser and begin using.

## Usage

Clicking on the "Get Started" button on the homepage will take you to a secondary page containing your notes.  Simply type a title and text for your new note and click "Save Note" when you want to save it.  You can also click "Clear Form" to delete the text you've entered if you want to start over.  If you want to delete a note, click on the red trash bin icon near the note you want to delete.
